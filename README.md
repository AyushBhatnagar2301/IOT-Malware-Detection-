This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Internet of Things (IoT) environments using machine learning models. The IDS monitors device logs in real-time, detects anomalies or potential malware infections, sends alerts to administrators, and periodically retrains the models to adapt to evolving threats.


Overview
The IoT Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses machine learning models to detect malicious activities in IoT networks. The models are trained on the NSL-KDD dataset and integrated into an IoT environment for real-time monitoring. The system includes an alerting mechanism to notify administrators of detected threats and a process for periodic model retraining.

Dataset
The NSL-KDD dataset is used for training and testing the machine learning models. It includes records of network activities labeled as normal or attack types, providing a benchmark for evaluating intrusion detection methods.

Models Used
Three different models are implemented and compared:

Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Neural Network
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, seaborn, matplotlib, joblib
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/iot-ids.git
cd iot-ids
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the NSL-KDD dataset and place it in the data directory.

Integration into IoT Environment
Model Export: Save the trained models for deployment.

python
Copy code
# For neural networks
nn_model.save('iot_intrusion_model.h5')

# For other models
import joblib
joblib.dump(rf_model, 'rf_model.pkl')
Deploy the Model: Host the models on a server or cloud service that interfaces with your IoT devices.

Setup Data Pipeline: Collect logs from IoT devices, preprocess the data, and feed it to the model for real-time inference.

Real-Time Inference: Use a script to load the model and predict anomalies from incoming logs.

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np

model = load_model('iot_intrusion_model.h5')

def predict_anomaly(log_data):
    processed_data = preprocess(log_data)
    prediction = model.predict(np.array([processed_data]))
    return prediction
Integration with IoT Systems: Connect the inference script to your IoT data stream for real-time monitoring.
